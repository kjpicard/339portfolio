About Me 

Just to cover our bases, I'm from Connecticut, and I go to school at the University of Michigan. Whew. That's it.

Just kidding! While those statements are true, there are at least a few more things to me.


My sister, Lauren, is my best friend. Don't be fooled by how similar we look--we are very different in some ways. The best part is that our differences are complementary; so, combined we would form one unvincible human being. For example, Lauren has a heart and considers people's feelings when making decisions whereas I operate on cold-hearted practicality.
